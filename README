Perl module Geo::Coder::HostIP
==============================

Geo::Coder::HostIP is designed to provide a Perl OO interface to the
hostip.org project's API for retrieving geocoding information from an
IP address.

It also provides several convenience methods, including writing code
for a Google Map for you (though nothing super complex -- you can add
Javascript, salt and wasabe later to taste).

It provides methods for retrieving a hash of geographical information
where possible, composed of (at best) Country, Country Code, City, State, 
and Letitude and Longitude (in decimal format).

It also uses gethostbyname() to be able to grab this info from hostip.org
(which only accepts numeric IP addresses, not domain names) where possible.
